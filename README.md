This is the submission for Shippable's coding challenge.

This is a barebones version of the open issues challenge on the website, and deals with only the display of the open issues of any given public repository and displays it as a table. I have taken approximately an hour and a half to figure this out.

I have polled the gitHub API to get JSON data related to open issues and used the BootStrap table plugin to display the data. 

Given more time, I think I would be able to build a better User Interface, and use more data from the GitHub API to make the table richer in information and also use the current information like time and display it in a more usable way(like 2 hours ago instead of the exact timestamp).
